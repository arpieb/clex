# Clex

The **Clex** Elixir package wraps the excellent Erlang NIF provided by [tonyrog/cl](https://github.com/tonyrog/cl) who has been a great resource during the development of **Clex**.  The modules provide a versioned interface into the OpenCL drivers available on most systems for cross-device (primarily CPU and GPU) development and execution of high-performance software kernels.

## What is OpenCL?

**OpenCL** (Open Computing Language) is an open royalty-free standard for general purpose parallel programming across CPUs, GPUs and other processors, giving software developers portable and efficient access to the power of these heterogeneous processing platforms.

OpenCL supports a wide range of applications, ranging from embedded and consumer software to HPC solutions, through a low-level, high-performance, portable abstraction. By creating an efficient, close-to-the-metal programming interface, OpenCL will form the foundation layer of a parallel computing ecosystem of platform-independent tools, middleware and applications.

OpenCL consists of an API for coordinating parallel computation across heterogeneous processors; and a cross-platform programming language with a well-specified computation environment. The OpenCL standard:

- Supports both data- and task-based parallel programming models
- Utilizes a subset of ISO C99 with extensions for parallelism
- Defines consistent numerical requirements based on IEEE 754
- Defines a configuration profile for handheld and embedded devices
- Efficiently interoperates with OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and other graphics APIs

The specification is divided into a core specification that any OpenCL compliant implementation must support; a handheld/embedded profile which relaxes the OpenCL compliance requirements for handheld and embedded devices; and a set of optional extensions that are likely to move into the core specification in later revisions of the OpenCL specification. 

## OpenCL versions

The **Clex** package currently supports all 1.x versions of the OpenCL specs:

- [OpenCL 1.0](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml) via `Clex.CL10`
- [OpenCL 1.1](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml) via `Clex.CL11`
- [OpenCL 1.2](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml) via `Clex.CL12`
  
Not all functions are implemented due to constraints within the BEAM and/or lack of support in the underlying NIF.  The following OpenCL functions do not have analogues in **Clex**:

- `clCreateUserEvent`
- `clEnqueueNativeKernel`
- `clGetEventProfilingInfo`
- `clSetEventCallback`
- `clSetMemObjectDestructorCallback`
- `clSetUserEventStatus`

## Why write an Elixir wrapper?

Some of the Erlang calls in the NIF are not idiomatic Elixir, and this wrapper attempts to provide that more idiomatic interface as well as [ExDoc](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_doc) support for the versioned modules and functions.  There are also plans to bundle OpenCL implementations of standard kernel libraries (we're eyeballing [clMathLibraries](https://github.com/clMathLibraries) for starters). 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `clex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:clex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/clex](https://hexdocs.pm/clex).
